The Outpost Project is a versatile, yet highly secured operating system (RTOS) supporting embedded hardware architectures.

The Outpost operating system is based on the micro-kernel and micro-service paradigm in order to delivers efficient yet small and performant environment in order to build constrained and secured systems such as crypto-enabled devices.
The Outpost operating system is designed in order to enables high performances functions to be executed alongside a Secure Element, including
security considerations from the boot sequence up to the functional service execution.

The Outpost kernel supports ARM Cortex-M in the armv7-m and armv8-m derivatives, and is designed to be easily ported to other platforms such as RISC-V.
